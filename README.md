## Project Description: Reducing Test Bench Time for Mercedes-Benz Cars

This project aims to optimize the testing system for Mercedes-Benz cars by reducing the time spent on the test bench. The goal is to leverage powerful algorithms to improve efficiency, lower carbon dioxide emissions, and maintain the high standards set by Mercedes-Benz.

Mercedes-Benz, a leader in the premium car industry, is renowned for its continuous innovation and commitment to safety. With a wide range of features and customization options available, each car configuration needs to undergo rigorous testing to ensure safety and reliability before hitting the road. However, the process of optimizing the testing system for numerous feature combinations is complex and time-consuming without a data-driven approach.

To address this challenge, we will work with a dataset representing different permutations of features in Mercedes-Benz cars. By leveraging advanced algorithmic techniques, we aim to predict the time it takes for each car configuration to pass testing. This prediction model will enable faster testing, resulting in reduced carbon dioxide emissions while upholding the exceptional standards of Mercedes-Benz.

The project will involve the following key steps:

1. Data Preprocessing

2. Label Encoding

3. Dimensionality Reduction

4. Model Training and Prediction
